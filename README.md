Dance from [MMD CharaLover201x](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAbBCswR5F0Y_oyhupVGwSA) to the music of [Virtual Riot - Continue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OiOZ_9XYBI)

### Tasks Performed
- Using CATS Blender Plugin I added mouth visemes for speaking and eye tracking and made it compatible for non-VR use within VRChat.
- Created a new shader based off the Flat Lit Toon shader that adds normals to both sides of planes. This allows for the ribbons/bows/other components to have both sides rendered. Called Flat Lit Toon Double.
- Ported custom animations from MMD to be used with the facial expression keys. Unlike the emote keys, this allows for the animations/dances to be canceled.
